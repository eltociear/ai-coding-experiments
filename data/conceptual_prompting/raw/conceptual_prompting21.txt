Here is the Python code for calculating the biodiversity index using the Simpson's Diversity Index:

```python
def calculate_simpsons_diversity_index(species_counts):
    """
    Calculate the Simpson's Diversity Index based on the species counts in an ecosystem.
    
    :param species_counts: a list of counts of different species in the ecosystem
    :return: the Simpson's Diversity Index (D) as a float
    """
    total_count = sum(species_counts)
    sum_of_squares = sum([count ** 2 for count in species_counts])
    diversity_index = 1 - sum_of_squares / (total_count ** 2)

    return diversity_index


def main():
    # Example species counts in an ecosystem
    example_counts = [45, 22, 16, 9, 8]
    biodiversity_index = calculate_simpsons_diversity_index(example_counts)
    print("The biodiversity index of the given ecosystem is:", biodiversity_index)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Here is a separate code block with pytest tests for the `calculate_simpsons_diversity_index` function:

```python
import pytest
from biodiversity import calculate_simpsons_diversity_index


def test_calculate_simpsons_diversity_index():
    test_data = [
        ([45, 22, 16, 9, 8], 0.7386978417266187),
        ([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 0.8),
        ([100, 0, 0], 0.98),
        ([1], 0),
        ([50, 50], 0.5),
    ]

    for counts, expected_diversity_index in test_data:
        result = calculate_simpsons_diversity_index(counts)
        assert pytest.approx(result) == expected_diversity_index
```

To run the tests, save the Python code with the function in a file named `biodiversity.py`, and the tests in a file named `test_biodiversity.py`. Then, run `pytest` in the terminal.
