I have prepared a Python program for you to calculate the potential energy stored in a spring. Here it is:

```python
def potential_energy(spring_constant, displacement):
    """
    This function calculates the potential energy stored in a spring.
    :param spring_constant: spring's spring constant (k) in N/m
    :param displacement: displacement from equilibrium position (x) in meters
    :return: potential energy (PE) in joules
    """
    return 0.5 * spring_constant * (displacement ** 2)


def main():
    spring_constant = 100  # Spring constant (k) in N/m
    displacement = 0.1  # Displacement from equilibrium position (x) in meters

    # Calculate and display the potential energy
    pe = potential_energy(spring_constant, displacement)
    print(f"The potential energy stored in the spring is {pe} joules.")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The first function, `potential_energy`, calculates the potential energy stored in a spring based on the given spring constant and displacement. The `main` function sets values for the spring constant and displacement, and then calls the `potential_energy` function to find the potential energy. Finally, the potential energy is printed to the console.

Here is a set of pytest tests to exercise the `potential_energy` function:

```python
import pytest
from spring_potential_energy import potential_energy

def test_potential_energy():
    assert potential_energy(100, 0.1) == 0.5
    assert potential_energy(200, 0.2) == 4.0
    assert potential_energy(50, 0.5) == 6.25
    assert potential_energy(0, 0.3) == 0.0
    assert potential_energy(100, 0) == 0.0
```

To use these tests, you should save the main program in a file called `spring_potential_energy.py`, install pytest, and then run the tests using the `pytest` command.
