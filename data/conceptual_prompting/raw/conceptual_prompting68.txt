Here is the Python function to compute the wavelength of a photon, given its energy and Planck's constant:

```python
import scipy.constants

def compute_wavelength(energy, plancks_constant=scipy.constants.Planck):
    """
    Compute the wavelength of a photon given its energy and Plancks constant.

    :param energy: The energy of the photon (in Joules).
    :type energy: float
    :param plancks_constant: The Planck's constant (default: scipy.constants.Planck)
    :type plancks_constant: float
    :return: The wavelength of the photon (in meters).
    :rtype: float
    """
    speed_of_light = scipy.constants.speed_of_light

    wavelength = (plancks_constant * speed_of_light) / energy
    return wavelength
```

Here is a set of pytest tests to exercise the `compute_wavelength` function:

```python
import pytest
import scipy.constants
from wavelength import compute_wavelength

def test_compute_wavelength_positive_energy():
    energy = 4.135667696e-15  # Example energy value in Joules
    computed_wavelength = compute_wavelength(energy)
    expected_wavelength = 4.804351820101201e-07  # Expected wavelength in meters
    assert pytest.approx(computed_wavelength) == expected_wavelength

def test_compute_wavelength_with_custom_plancks_constant():
    energy = 4.135667696e-15  # Example energy value in Joules
    custom_plancks_constant = 6.62607015e-34  # Example custom Planck's constant in Js
    computed_wavelength = compute_wavelength(energy, custom_plancks_constant)
    expected_wavelength = 4.804351820101201e-07  # Expected wavelength in meters
    assert pytest.approx(computed_wavelength) == expected_wavelength

def test_compute_wavelength_invalid_energy():
    energy = -4.135667696e-15  # Example invalid energy value (negative) in Joules
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        compute_wavelength(energy)
```

Please save the code in separate files and run pytest from your terminal:
- Save the first code block in a file named "wavelength.py"
- Save the second code block in a file named "test_wavelength.py"
- Run `pytest test_wavelength.py` in your terminal
