Here is the Python code to calculate the carrying capacity of an ecosystem:

```python
def carrying_capacity(rate, initial_population, max_population):
    """
    Calculate the carrying capacity of an ecosystem.

    Parameters:
    rate (float): Population growth rate.
    initial_population (int): Initial population size.
    max_population (int): Maximum sustainable population.

    Returns:
    float: Carrying capacity of the ecosystem.
    """

    return (rate * initial_population * (max_population - initial_population)) / max_population

# Example values
growth_rate = 0.1
initial_pop = 100
max_sustainable_population = 1000

# Calculate the carrying capacity
capacity = carrying_capacity(growth_rate, initial_pop, max_sustainable_population)
print("Carrying capacity:", capacity)
```

Here are some pytest tests for the `carrying_capacity` function:

```python
import pytest
from ecosystem import carrying_capacity

def test_carrying_capacity():
    # Test with sample values
    assert carrying_capacity(0.1, 100, 1000) == 90.0

    # Test with zero rate
    assert carrying_capacity(0, 100, 1000) == 0

    # Test with zero initial population
    assert carrying_capacity(0.1, 0, 1000) == 0

    # Test with equal initial and maximum population
    assert carrying_capacity(0.1, 1000, 1000) == 0

    # Test with irrational numbers
    assert carrying_capacity(0.333, 500, 1234) == pytest.approx(138.327, rel=1e-3)
```

Make sure to save the first code snippet in a file named `ecosystem.py` and the second code snippet in a separate file named `test_ecosystem.py`. Then, run `pytest test_ecosystem.py` to test the function.
