Here's the Python code to calculate the economic profit of a firm:

```python
def calculate_economic_profit(total_revenue, total_cost, opportunity_cost):
    """
    Calculate the economic profit of a firm.

    Args:
    total_revenue (float): The firm's total revenue.
    total_cost (float): The firm's total cost.
    opportunity_cost (float): The opportunity cost for the firm's investment.

    Returns:
    float: Economic profit calculated as total_revenue - total_cost - opportunity_cost.
    """
    economic_profit = total_revenue - total_cost - opportunity_cost
    return economic_profit

# Example usage:
total_revenue = 100000
total_cost = 80000
opportunity_cost = 5000

economic_profit = calculate_economic_profit(total_revenue, total_cost, opportunity_cost)
print("Economic Profit:", economic_profit)
```

Here's a set of pytest tests for the `calculate_economic_profit` function:

```python
import pytest
from economic_profit import calculate_economic_profit

def test_calculate_economic_profit_positive():
    assert calculate_economic_profit(100000, 80000, 5000) == 15000

def test_calculate_economic_profit_zero():
    assert calculate_economic_profit(100000, 95000, 5000) == 0

def test_calculate_economic_profit_negative():
    assert calculate_economic_profit(100000, 105000, 5000) == -10000

def test_calculate_economic_profit_invalid_arguments():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        calculate_economic_profit("100000", "80000", "5000")
