Here's a Python code to model the population dynamics of a species.

```python
import numpy as np

def next_population(population, birth_rate, death_rate, carrying_capacity):
    # Calculate the net growth rate, considering intrinsic birth and death rates
    growth_rate = birth_rate - death_rate
    
    # Implement the logistic growth model
    population_change = growth_rate * population * (1 - population / carrying_capacity)
    next_population = population + population_change
    return next_population

def apply_environmental_stochasticity(population, var):
    # Apply environmental stochasticity
    random_factor = np.random.normal(1, var)
    population = population * random_factor
    return max(0, population)

def simulate_population_dynamics(initial_population, birth_rate, death_rate, carrying_capacity, env_stochasticity, n_years):
    populations = [initial_population]
    
    for _ in range(n_years):
        next_pop = next_population(populations[-1], birth_rate, death_rate, carrying_capacity)
        next_pop = apply_environmental_stochasticity(next_pop, env_stochasticity)
        populations.append(next_pop)
    
    return populations

# Example values
initial_population = 100
birth_rate = 0.3
death_rate = 0.1
carrying_capacity = 500
env_stochasticity = 0.05
n_years = 25

simulated_populations = simulate_population_dynamics(initial_population, birth_rate, death_rate, carrying_capacity, env_stochasticity, n_years)
print(simulated_populations)
```

Here's a set of pytest tests to exercise each of the functions.

```python
import pytest
from your_module import next_population, apply_environmental_stochasticity, simulate_population_dynamics

def test_next_population():
    assert next_population(100, 0.3, 0.1, 500) == 110
    assert next_population(200, 0.4, 0.2, 300) == 190

def test_apply_environmental_stochasticity():
    np.random.seed(42)
    assert np.isclose(apply_environmental_stochasticity(100, 0.05), 99.40441493)
    assert np.isclose(apply_environmental_stochasticity(200, 0.1), 186.22433877)

def test_simulate_population_dynamics():
    np.random.seed(42)
    sim_pop = simulate_population_dynamics(10, 0.3, 0.1, 50, 0.05, 5)
    expected_pop = [10, 21.89875327, 40.58503309, 50.8704097, 50.98687313, 49.92140979]
    
    for i in range(5):
        assert np.isclose(sim_pop[i], expected_pop[i])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
```

You will need to replace `from your_module` with the appropriate import statement for your project. The tests assume you have these functions defined in a module you've created.
