Here is the Python function to calculate the price elasticity of demand:

```python
def price_elasticity_of_demand(percent_change_quantity_demanded, percent_change_price):
    """
    Calculate the price elasticity of demand.

    Arguments:
    percent_change_quantity_demanded -- percentage change in quantity demanded
    percent_change_price -- percentage change in price

    Returns:
    Price elasticity of demand
    """
    if percent_change_price == 0:
        raise ValueError("Percentage change in price cannot be 0")

    price_elasticity = percent_change_quantity_demanded / percent_change_price
    return price_elasticity
```

Here are some pytest tests to exercise the function:

```python
import pytest
from your_module import price_elasticity_of_demand

def test_positive_elasticity():
    assert price_elasticity_of_demand(-10, 5) == -2

def test_negative_elasticity():
    assert price_elasticity_of_demand(5, 5) == 1

def test_inelastic_demand():
    assert price_elasticity_of_demand(-5, 20) == -0.25

def test_division_by_zero():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        price_elasticity_of_demand(5, 0)
```

Make sure to replace `your_module` in the pytest tests with the name of the file where the `price_elasticity_of_demand` function is defined.
