Here's a Python function that models the production function of a firm, given the input quantities and their respective production elasticities:

```python
def production_function(input_quantities, elasticities):
    """
    Calculate the production output of a firm, given the input quantities and their respective production elasticities.

    :param input_quantities: list of input quantities
    :param elasticities: list of production elasticities for each input
    :return: total production output
    """
    if len(input_quantities) != len(elasticities):
        raise ValueError("Input quantities and elasticities must have the same length.")

    output = 1
    for q, e in zip(input_quantities, elasticities):
        output *= q ** e
    return output


# Example usage:
input_quantities = [100, 200, 300]
elasticities = [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]

production_output = production_function(input_quantities, elasticities)
print(f"Production output: {production_output}")
```

For testing the function using `pytest`, you can write the following test cases:

```python
import pytest
from production_function import production_function


def test_production_function_valid():
    input_quantities = [100, 200, 300]
    elasticities = [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]
    assert production_function(input_quantities, elasticities) == 100 ** 0.3 * 200 ** 0.4 * 300 ** 0.3


def test_production_function_zero_inputs():
    input_quantities = [0, 0, 0]
    elasticities = [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]
    assert production_function(input_quantities, elasticities) == 0


def test_production_function_zero_elasticities():
    input_quantities = [100, 200, 300]
    elasticities = [0, 0, 0]
    assert production_function(input_quantities, elasticities) == 1


def test_production_function_mismatched_lengths():
    input_quantities = [100, 200, 300]
    elasticities = [0.3, 0.4]
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        production_function(input_quantities, elasticities)
```

Note that to run the tests, you will need to have `pytest` installed. You can install it using `pip`:

```
pip install pytest
```
