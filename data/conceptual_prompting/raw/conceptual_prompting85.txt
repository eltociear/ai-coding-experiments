Here's a simple and modular code to calculate the diffraction angle for light through a single slit:

```python
import math

# Default values for wavelength, slit_width, and screen_distance in meters.
DEFAULT_WAVELENGTH = 6.3e-7
DEFAULT_SLIT_WIDTH = 0.001
DEFAULT_SCREEN_DISTANCE = 1.0

def diffraction_angle(wavelength, slit_width, screen_distance):
    """
    Compute the diffraction angle of light through a single slit.

    Args:
        wavelength (float): Wavelength of light in meters.
        slit_width (float): Width of the slit in meters.
        screen_distance (float): Distance from the slit to the screen in meters.
    
    Returns:
        float: The diffraction angle in radians.
    """
    angle = math.asin(wavelength / slit_width)

    if screen_distance > 0:
        return angle
    else:
        raise ValueError("The distance to the screen must be greater than 0.")

# Example usage
angle = diffraction_angle(DEFAULT_WAVELENGTH, DEFAULT_SLIT_WIDTH, DEFAULT_SCREEN_DISTANCE)
print(f"Diffraction angle: {angle:.10f} radians")
```

Here's a set of pytest tests for this code:

```python
import pytest
from diffraction_angle_calculator import diffraction_angle

def test_diffraction_angle():
    wavelength = 6.3e-7
    slit_width = 0.001
    screen_distance = 1.0

    angle = diffraction_angle(wavelength, slit_width, screen_distance)
    assert round(angle, 10) == 0.0006300000

def test_invalid_screen_distance():
    wavelength = 6.3e-7
    slit_width = 0.001
    screen_distance = 0

    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="The distance to the screen must be greater than 0"):
        diffraction_angle(wavelength, slit_width, screen_distance)

def test_large_screen_distance():
    wavelength = 6.3e-7
    slit_width = 0.001
    screen_distance = 100.0

    angle = diffraction_angle(wavelength, slit_width, screen_distance)
    assert round(angle, 10) == 0.0006300000
```

Make sure to save the function in a file named `diffraction_angle_calculator.py` for the tests to work since the tests import the function from that file.
