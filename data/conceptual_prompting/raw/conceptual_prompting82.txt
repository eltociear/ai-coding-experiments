Here's the Python code for the Keynesian aggregate expenditure model:

```python
def consumption_function(consumption, marginal_propensity_to_consume, disposable_income):
    return consumption + marginal_propensity_to_consume * disposable_income

def aggregate_expenditure(consumption, investment, government_spending, net_exports):
    return consumption + investment + government_spending + net_exports

def keynesian_model(income, consumption, marginal_propensity_to_consume, investment, government_spending, net_exports):
    disposable_income = income
    total_consumption = consumption_function(consumption, marginal_propensity_to_consume, disposable_income)
    total_expenditure = aggregate_expenditure(total_consumption, investment, government_spending, net_exports)
    return total_expenditure

# Example values
income = 1000
consumption = 200
marginal_propensity_to_consume = 0.6
investment = 150
government_spending = 300
net_exports = 50

total_expenditure = keynesian_model(income, consumption, marginal_propensity_to_consume, investment, government_spending, net_exports)
print("Total Expenditure:", total_expenditure)
```

And here's a set of pytest tests to test the functions:

```python
import pytest
from keynesian_model import consumption_function, aggregate_expenditure, keynesian_model

def test_consumption_function():
    assert consumption_function(200, 0.6, 1000) == 800
    assert consumption_function(100, 0.8, 500) == 500
    assert consumption_function(300, 0.5, 1500) == 1050

def test_aggregate_expenditure():
    assert aggregate_expenditure(800, 150, 300, 50) == 1300
    assert aggregate_expenditure(500, 100, 400, 30) == 1030
    assert aggregate_expenditure(1050, 200, 500, 20) == 1770

def test_keynesian_model():
    assert keynesian_model(1000, 200, 0.6, 150, 300, 50) == 1300
    assert keynesian_model(500, 100, 0.8, 100, 400, 30) == 1030
    assert keynesian_model(1500, 300, 0.5, 200, 500, 20) == 1770
```

Save the tests in a separate file and run them with pytest. Make sure to import the necessary functions from the main code file to the test file.
