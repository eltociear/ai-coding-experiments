Here is the Python code to compute the speed of sound in a medium:

```python
import math

def compute_speed_of_sound(bulk_modulus, density):
    """
    Compute the speed of sound in a medium.
    
    Args:
        bulk_modulus (float): The bulk modulus of the medium (in Pa).
        density (float): The density of the medium (in kg/m^3).
        
    Returns:
        float: The speed of sound in the medium (in m/s).
    """
    return math.sqrt(bulk_modulus / density)

# Example: Compute the speed of sound in water
# Bulk modulus of water: 2.15e9 Pa (at 20 °C)
# Density of water: 1000 kg/m³ (at 20 °C)
water_bulk_modulus = 2.15e9
water_density = 1000
speed_of_sound_water = compute_speed_of_sound(water_bulk_modulus, water_density)
print(f"Speed of sound in water: {speed_of_sound_water:.2f} m/s")
```

Here is a set of pytest tests for the `compute_speed_of_sound` function:

```python
import pytest

    assert pytest.approx(1463.14, abs=1e-2) == speed_of_sound_water

    # Test with known values for air
    air_bulk_modulus = 1.42e5
    air_density = 1.225
    speed_of_sound_air = compute_speed_of_sound(air_bulk_modulus, air_density)
    assert pytest.approx(331.44, abs=1e-2) == speed_of_sound_air

    # Test with custom values, speed should be greater than 0 unless bulk modulus or density is 0
    custom_bulk_modulus = 5.0e8
    custom_density = 1200
    speed_of_sound_custom = compute_speed_of_sound(custom_bulk_modulus, custom_density)
    assert speed_of_sound_custom > 0

    # Test with 0 bulk modulus, speed should be 0
    zero_bulk_modulus = 0
    speed_of_sound_zero_bulk_modulus = compute_speed_of_sound(zero_bulk_modulus, custom_density)
    assert speed_of_sound_zero_bulk_modulus == 0

    # Test with 0 density, speed should be 0
    zero_density = 0
