Here's a Python function to compute the work done by a force on an object:

```python
import math

def work_done(force, distance, angle):
    """
    Calculate work done based on the given force, distance, and angle.
    
    Args:
    force (float): The force applied on the object (in Newtons).
    distance (float): The distance the object is displaced (in meters).
    angle (float): The angle between the force and displacement (in degrees).

    Returns:
    float: work done in Joules.
    """
    # Convert angle from degrees to radians
    angle_rad = math.radians(angle)

    # Calculate work done
    work = force * distance * math.cos(angle_rad)

    return work
```

Now, here is a set of pytest tests to exercise the function:

```python
import pytest
from work_done_module import work_done

def test_work_done():
    assert work_done(50, 10, 0) == 500
    assert work_done(0, 10, 45) == 0
    assert work_done(50, 0, 45) == 0
    assert work_done(50, 10, 45) == pytest.approx(353.55, 0.01)
    assert work_done(50, 10, 90) == 0
```

Save the function in a module named `work_done_module.py` and the tests in a file named `test_work_done.py`. To run the tests, install pytest (`pip install pytest`) and run `pytest test_work_done.py` in your terminal.
