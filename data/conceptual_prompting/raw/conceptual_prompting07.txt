Here's the Python program to calculate the present value of a future cash flow:

```python
def present_value(future_value, discount_rate, years):
    """
    Calculate the present value of a future cash flow.
    
    Parameters:
    future_value (float): The future cash amount
    discount_rate (float): The discount rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
    years (float): The number of years until the cash flow is received

    Returns:
    float: The present value of the future cash flow
    """
    return future_value / ((1 + discount_rate) ** years)

# Example usage
future_value = 10000  # A future cash flow of 10,000
discount_rate = 0.05  # A discount rate of 5%
years = 10  # The cash flow will be received in 10 years

present_value_result = present_value(future_value, discount_rate, years)
print(f"The present value of the future cash flow is: {present_value_result:.2f}")
```

And here's a set of pytest tests that exercise each of the functions:

```python
import pytest
from present_value import present_value

def test_present_value_positive():
    assert present_value(10000, 0.05, 10) == pytest.approx(6139.13, rel=1e-2)
    assert present_value(5000, 0.04, 5) == pytest.approx(4106.92, rel=1e-2)

def test_present_value_zero():
    assert present_value(0, 0.05, 10) == 0
    assert present_value(10000, 0, 10) == 10000

def test_present_value_negative_rate():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        present_value(10000, -0.05, 10)

def test_present_value_negative_years():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        present_value(10000, 0.05, -10)
```
